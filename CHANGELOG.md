# Changelog

## [0.1.1]

- Fixes the macOS application bundle and DMG to display the Warpforge icon
  instead of the generic application placeholder.
- Fixes Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Qwen logos in packaged desktop builds.
- Explains when the published update feed is not available before the first
  signed desktop release instead of exposing a low-level manifest error.

## [0.1.0]

- Introduces the Warpforge desktop app: a local meta-harness for running projects, services, and coding agents from one workspace.
- Adds project management for registering, opening, and removing workspaces without manual setup.
- Moves long-running services and agent sessions into a local daemon so work can continue independently of the desktop window.
- Brings Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, and custom ACP-compatible agents together with multi-agent orchestration and shared project context.
- Assigns predictable per-project port ranges, allowing multiple projects and agent-built previews to run side by side without port conflicts.
- Implements and delivers application updates with a versioned desktop/daemon protocol and bundled runtime. Windows and Linux builds remain unvalidated previews, and the first end-to-end N→N+1 update test requires a published release.
